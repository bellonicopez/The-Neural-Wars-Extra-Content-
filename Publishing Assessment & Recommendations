Hi, I would like to show you the full 2 books so you tell me what you think. Is the narrative ready to impact the books shop? I'm planning to publish them on amazon KDP, a professional graphic is preparing me covers, and my sister will probably make me a website, with the social media content and stuff... I'll take care of marketing my paying some sponsored announcement to make noise about the books. My need right now is you to watch all general aspects that you can help me improving, but mostly I need you to ensure that the work is an unique piece of art, and it will have on impact for its artistic value, and when people reads it they get inspired and excited about what they are reading. 
Here are the complete books attached.
