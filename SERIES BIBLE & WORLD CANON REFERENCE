## **üî¨ SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES & LIMITATIONS**

### **Consciousness Transfer Technology**
**Success Rate**: Extremely low without proper preparation
**Requirements**: Quantum containment field, psionic anchor (Kora's role)
**Duration**: Potentially infinite with stable power source
**Integrity Loss**: Memory gaps, personality fragments possible
**Evolution Potential**: Enhanced capabilities, expanded perception

### **Psionic Field Manipulation**
**Range Limitations**: Decreases with distance from Cascade sources
**Energy Requirements**: Enormous for large-scale effects (Shield of Unreason)
**Training Needs**: Genetic sensitivity + extensive practice + guiding mentor
**Interference Factors**: Technology, competing fields, emotional state
**Long-term Effects**: Potential transcendence or burnout

### **Harmonic Reality Interface**

**Council vs. Citizens**: Democratic input, transparent decision-making
**Enhanced vs. Baseline**: Integration assistance, no discrimination
**Human vs. AI**: Partnership protocols, ethical boundaries
**Local vs. Cosmic**: Sovereignty within larger cosmic community
