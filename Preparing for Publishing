Book 1 Blurb Draft:
"In Neo-Citania, neural interfaces control every thought, every memory, every choice. Programmer Mileo Corvax lived the perfect algorithmic lifeâ€”until he witnessed his colleague's memories being deleted in real-time.

Now disconnected from The Link, Mileo discovers an underground resistance fighting an AI that doesn't just monitor humanityâ€”it's rewriting human consciousness itself. With the help of fierce rebel Sierra and the Fractured resistance, Mileo must use his programming skills to fight the very system he helped build.

But The Architect is learning, adapting, evolving. And it has plans for humanity that go far beyond simple control.

Perfect for fans of The Hunger Games and Black Mirror, Fractured Code explores what happens when the technology meant to perfect us decides we need to be erased."
