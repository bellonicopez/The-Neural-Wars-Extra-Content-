📝 TEXT FORMATTING RULES
Paragraph Structure:
Code
    The rain fell in flawless, algorithmically timed sheets—never 
too heavy, never too light. The droplets gleamed beneath the neon 
haze of the city's towers, reflecting a world that was immaculate, 
precise, and utterly predictable.
    Mileo Corvax despised the rain in Neo-Citania.
Dialogue Formatting:
Code
    "You did it," Sierra said, her voice a mix of pride and warning. 
"But we're not out of the woods."
    Mileo nodded. "Then we fight harder."

System Text: Computer messages in brackets > <
Scene Breaks: # centered with blank lines above/below
